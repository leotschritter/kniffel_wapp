        <h1 id="kniffel">Kniffel - Game Rules</h1>
        <h2 id="game-summary">Game Summary</h2>
        <p>On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination for one of 13 categories.
            After you finish rolling, you must place a score or a zero in one of the 13 category boxes on your score column.
            The game ends when all players have filled in their 13 boxes.
            Scores are totaled, including any bonus points. The player with the highest total wins.</p>
        <h2 id="taking-a-turn">Taking a turn</h2>
        <p>On your turn, you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and score after your first or second roll.
            To roll the dice, click the dice Button.</br>
            <img src="assets/images/about_dice_button.png"/>
        </p>
        <h3 id="keep-dice-aside">Keep dice aside</h3>
        <p>After each roll you may want to set any &quot;keepers&quot; aside.
            To do so you can select multiple dice on the left-hand side.
            After that you can commit the dice/die you want to keep by clicking the right arrow Button.
            <img src="assets/images/about_dice_right.png"/>
            </br></br>
        </p>
        <p>In this example our decision was to put two fours aside.</p>
        <h3 id="put-dice-back-into-the-cup">Put dice back into the cup</h3>
        <p>You may change your mind after any roll.
            At any time you can decide if you want to put dice back into the Cup.
            To do so you can select a single or multiple dice from the right-hand side just like you did before where you put
            them aside. You may also want to put all dices back in. Therefore, you can use the double left arrow button.
            In this case no selection is needed.
            <img src="assets/images/about_dice_double_left.png"/>
    <h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
        <p>When you&#39;re finished rolling, decide which box to fill in on your score column.
            You must fill in a box on each turn; if you can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) enter a score, you must enter a zero.
            To enter any score to your column you have to select one option on the left side of the GUI.</br></br>

            If you decide to click the &#39;Chance&#39;-Button then this Button will be disabled in your next round.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="scoring-combinations">Scoring Combinations</h3>
        <p>To score in the Upper Section, only dice with the same number will count.</br></br>
            Your goal in the Upper Section is to score a total of at least 63 points, to earn a 35-point bonus.
            The bonus points are based on scoring of each number;
            however, you may earn the bonus with any combination of scores totaling 63 points or more.
            Each of the Lower Section scoring combinations is explained in detail in the next second column of the GUI.</p>
        <h4 id="3-of-a-kind-">3 of a Kind:</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice include 3 or more of the same number.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="4-of-a-kind-">4 of a Kind:</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice include 4 or more of the same number.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="full-house-">Full House:</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice show three of one number and two of another. Any Full House is worth 25 points.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="small-straight-">Small Straight:</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of four numbers. Any Small Straight is worth 30 points.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="large-straight">Large Straight</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of four numbers. Any Large Straight is worth 40 points.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="kniffel">Kniffel</h4>
        <p>Score in this box only if the dice show five of the same number (5 of a kind).
            You can score 50 points in the Kniffel box.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="chance">Chance</h4>
        <p>Score the total of any 5 dice in this box. This catch-all category comes handy when you can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want
            to) score in another category, and don&#39;t want to enter a zero.</br></br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="ending-a-game">Ending a Game</h3>
        <p>Once each player has filled in all 13 category boxes, the game ends.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-win">How to Win</h3>
        <p>After the scores are tallied, the player with the highest &#39;Endsumme&#39; wins the game!</p>
